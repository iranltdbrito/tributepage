            <p>
                Nikola Tesla, born July 10th 1856 and death January 7th 1943,<br> was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,<br> mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions<br> to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. <br><br>
                Born and raised in the Austrian Empire,<br> Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree,<br> gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony<br> and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.<br> In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.<br> He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City<br> before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas,<br> Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.<br> His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents,<br> licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money <br>and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.<br><br>
                Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market,<br> Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators,<br> electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat,<br> one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his <br>achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his <br>showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless <br>lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency <br>power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements <br>on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas <br>to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless <br>communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<br><br>
                After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions <br>in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of <br>his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind<br> unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.<br><br>
                Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following <br>his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on <br>Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has <br>been a resurgence in popular <br>interest in Tesla since the 1990s.<br><br>
